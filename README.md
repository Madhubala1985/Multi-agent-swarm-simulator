# Multi-Agent Swarm Intelligence Simulator

## Overview
The **Multi-Agent Swarm Intelligence Simulator** is a tool designed to replicate swarm behavior (e.g., birds, ants, robots) using intelligent agents. The simulator allows users to analyze swarm dynamics, test optimization algorithms, and visualize interactions in real time.

## Features
### Core Functionalities
- **Agent Behavior Simulation**: Implements rules like alignment, cohesion, and separation.
- **Environment Setup**: Supports different environments with dynamic obstacles.
- **Visualization**: Real-time 2D/3D agent movement visualization.
- **Algorithm Testing**: Includes standard swarm intelligence algorithms (PSO, ACO) with customization.
- **Metrics and Analysis**: Provides performance metrics, reports, and visual graphs.

### Optional Functionalities
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Web-based and desktop versions.
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user simulation and experimentation.
- **Integration with ML Models**: Reinforcement learning support for agent training.
